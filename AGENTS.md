# ComplyBeacon

Open-source observability toolkit that collects, normalizes, and enriches compliance evidence by extending the OpenTelemetry standard. Uses a Go workspace monorepo with two active modules (`proofwatch`, `truthbeam`) and an OTel Collector distribution (`beacon-distro`).

```

## Constraints

- **Go workspace, no root go.mod**: This repo uses `go.work` to link modules. All module-level commands iterate over `MODULES := ./proofwatch ./truthbeam`. Running `go test ./...` from root will not work — use `task test`.
- **Generated files — DO NOT EDIT**:
  - `proofwatch/attributes.go` — regenerate with `task codegen:weaver-codegen`
  - `truthbeam/internal/applier/attributes.go` — regenerate with `task codegen:weaver-codegen`
  - `truthbeam/internal/client/client.gen.go` — regenerate with `task codegen:api-codegen`
  - `docs/attributes/*.md` — regenerate with `task codegen:weaver-docsgen`
- **Build automation**: Use `task` (taskfile.dev), not `make`. A deprecated Makefile exists but is not maintained.
- **External tools**: Install development tools with `task tools:install-all` or `task tools:install-weaver`. SHA256 checksums are pinned in `.tool_checksums` for supply chain security. Ginkgo CLI is managed as a `tool` directive in the root `go.mod` and invoked via `go tool ginkgo`.
- **Podman, not Docker**: Container operations use `podman` and `podman-compose`. Do not reference `docker` commands.
- **Lint**: Go linting uses `.golangci.yml` (v2 format). Multi-language CI linting uses `.mega-linter.yml`. No pre-commit hooks — run `task lint` locally.
- **Integration tests**: `tests/integration/` contains Ginkgo E2E tests and a mock Compass HTTP server. Run with `task integration:test` (all layers) or `task integration:test-profile PROFILE=base|storage|enrichment`. Do not recreate mock Compass — it already serves fixture-driven `/v1/enrich` responses.
- **Standards**: All coding standards are in `.specify/memory/constitution.md`. For architecture context, see `docs/DESIGN.md`. For dev setup, see `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md`.

## Local Dev Stack

The compose stack (`compose.yaml`) runs the full evidence pipeline locally:

- **Base** (always on): **Loki** (log aggregation), **collector** (OTel Collector with evidence processing)
- **Storage** (`--profile storage`): adds **rustfs** (S3-compatible object storage, API <http://localhost:9000>, console <http://localhost:9001>, credentials `rustfsadmin`/`rustfsadmin`)
- **Enrichment** (`--profile enrichment`): adds **Compass** (mock enrichment service for TruthBeam)
- **Debug** (`--profile debug`): adds **Grafana** (visualization, <http://localhost:3000>)

Collector config is selected via `COLLECTOR_CONFIG` env var (defaults to `configs/collector-base.yaml`).

All S3 environment variables have inline defaults that target rustfs. The stack works out-of-the-box with `task infra:deploy` — no AWS credentials needed. Override env vars in your shell to target real AWS S3 instead.

## Commits

All commits MUST use Conventional Commits, the `-s` flag (Signed-off-by), and include an `Assisted-by` trailer when AI-assisted. See `.specify/memory/constitution.md` for full details.

## Changelog

`CHANGELOG.md` follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) format. The audience is **users and adopting developers**, not contributors or CI.

**Principles:**

- Write entries that answer "what can I do now?" or "what changed for me?", not "what did we refactor internally?"
- Group by component scope (`proofwatch`, `truthbeam`, `beacon-distro`) when an entry is module-specific
- Use descriptive, multi-line entries that give enough context for someone unfamiliar with the codebase to understand the value — avoid terse one-liners that require reading source to interpret
- Internal tooling changes (CI actions, linter upgrades, dependency bumps, code quality tooling) are **not** changelog entries unless they affect the user experience or public API
- Do not use `BREAKING` labels until there is a prior release to break against
- `Changed` and `Removed` sections only apply when a released feature is modified or dropped — pre-release iteration is not a "change"
- Reference PR numbers only when they add traceability for significant features

## Integration Test Gotchas

- **RustFS is not MinIO**: The health endpoint is `/health`, not `/minio/health/live` (returns 403). The S3 API is compatible but administrative endpoints differ. The `rustfs-init` container uses `rc` (RustFS CLI), not `mc` (MinIO client).
- **Loki 3.x OTLP labels**: Loki no longer auto-creates `{exporter="OTLP"}` from OTLP ingestion. Query indexed labels from `otlp_config.resource_attributes` in `configs/loki.yaml` directly (e.g. `{policy_rule_id="..."}`). Log attributes are stored as structured metadata and can be filtered with `| key="value"` after the stream selector.
- **Podman rootless volume permissions**: The collector runs as UID 10001. Host-mounted volumes need the `:U` flag (podman ownership remapping) or the container can't write. The `:Z` flag alone only handles SELinux relabeling.
- **S3 test portability**: Don't depend on host-installed CLI tools (`aws`, `mc`). The test bucket is configured with anonymous public access via `rc anonymous set public` in `rustfs-init`, so tests can query the S3 ListObjectsV2 API with plain HTTP — no auth headers needed.
- **awss3 exporter partitioning**: When `resource_attrs_to_s3.s3_prefix` is set, it replaces (not appends to) the static `s3_prefix`. Objects land at `{resource_attr_value}/evidence_logs_{uuid}.json`, not `{s3_prefix}/{resource_attr_value}/...`.

## CI Workflow Gotchas

- **`artifact-metadata` is not a valid GitHub Actions permission** scope. The correct scope for build provenance attestations (actions/attest) is `attestations: write`. Using an invalid scope causes a startup_failure because GitHub validates all permission blocks including in reusable workflows before any job runs.
- **Reusable workflow permission validation is global**: When `ci_local.yml` calls `ci_publish_ghcr.yml` via `uses:`, GitHub parses and validates the called workflow's permissions block even if the calling job wouldn't run it. An invalid permission in any reusable workflow breaks the entire caller.
- **Required permissions for GHCR publish with attestations**: The `build-beacon-distro` job in `ci_publish_ghcr.yml` needs exactly: `contents: read`, `packages: write`, `id-token: write`, `actions: read`, `attestations: write`. Use `actions: read` (not `write`) for least privilege.
- **Quay publish has no attestation support**: `ci_publish_quay.yml` does not use `actions/attest` and does not need `attestations` or `id-token` permissions. Quay authentication uses `QUAY_USERNAME` and `QUAY_PASSWORD` repository secrets.
- **Validate with `actionlint`**: Run `actionlint .github/workflows/*.yml` locally before pushing workflow changes. It catches invalid permission scopes, syntax errors, and expression issues that GitHub only reports at runtime.
