# ComplyBeacon Design Documentation

## Key Features

- **OpenTelemetry Native**: Built on the OpenTelemetry standard for seamless integration with existing observability pipelines.
- **Automated Enrichment**: Enriches raw evidence with risk scores, threat mappings, and regulatory requirements via the Compass service.
- **Composability**: Components are designed as a toolkit; they are not required to be used together, and users can compose their own pipelines.
- **Compliance-as-Code**: Leverages the `gemara` model for a robust, auditable, and automated approach to risk assessment.

## Architecture Overview

### Design Principles

* **Modularity:** The system is composed of small, focused, and interchangeable services.

* **Standardization:** The architecture is built on OpenTelemetry to ensure broad compatibility and interoperability.

* **Operational Experience:** The toolkit is built for easy deployment, configuration, and maintenance using familiar cloud-native practices and protocols.


### Data Flow

The ComplyBeacon architecture is centered around a unified enrichment pipeline that processes and enriches compliance evidence. The primary data flow begins with a source that generates OpenTelemetry-compliant logs.

1. **Log Ingestion**: A source generates compliance evidence and sends it as a structured log record to the `Beacon` collector, typically using `ProofWatch` to handle the emission. This can also be done by an OpenTelemetry collector agent.
2. **Enrichment Request**: The log record is received by the `Beacon` collector and forwarded to the `truthbeam` processor. `truthbeam` extracts key attributes from the record and sends an enrichment request to the `Compass` API.
3. **Enrichment Lookup**: The `Compass` service performs a lookup based on the provided attributes and returns a response containing compliance-related context (e.g., impacted baselines, requirements, and risk).
4. **Attribute Injection**: `truthbeam` adds these new attributes from `Compass` to the original log record.
5. **Export**: The now-enriched log record is exported from the `Beacon` collector to a final destination (e.g., a SIEM, logging backend, or data lake) for analysis and correlation.

### Deployment Patterns

ComplyBeacon is designed to be a flexible toolkit. Its components can be used in different combinations to fit a variety of operational needs.

* **Full Pipeline**: The most common use case where `ProofWatch` emits events to the `Beacon` collector, which in turn uses `TruthBeam` and `Compass` to enrich and export logs to a final destination.
* **Integrating `TruthBeam`**: `TruthBeam` can be included in an existing OpenTelemetry Collector distribution, allowing you to add enrichment capabilities to your current observability pipeline.
* **Standalone `Compass`**: The `Compass` service can be deployed as an independent API, enabling it to be called by any application or a different enrichment processor within an existing OpenTelemetry or custom logging pipeline.

## Component Analysis

### 1. ProofWatch

**Purpose**: An instrumentation library for collecting and emitting compliance evidence as OpenTelemetry log streams. It provides a standardized interface for tracking policy evaluation events and compliance evidence in real-time.

**Key Responsibilities**:
* Converts compliance evidence data into standardized OpenTelemetry log records.
* Emits log records to the OpenTelemetry Collector using the OTLP (OpenTelemetry Protocol).
* Provides metrics and tracing for evidence collection and processing.

`proofwatch` attributes defined [here](./attributes)

_Example code snippet_
```go
import (
    "context"
    "log"
    
    "go.opentelemetry.io/otel/log"
    "github.com/complytime/complybeacon/proofwatch"
)

// Create a new ProofWatch instance
pw, err := proofwatch.NewProofWatch()
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}

// Create evidence (example with GemaraEvidence)
evidence := proofwatch.GemaraEvidence{
    // ... populate evidence fields
}

// Log evidence with default severity
err = pw.Log(ctx, evidence)
if err != nil {
    return fmt.Errorf("error logging evidence: %w", err)
}

// Or log with specific severity
err = pw.LogWithSeverity(ctx, evidence, olog.SeverityWarn)
```

### 2. Beacon Collector Distro

**Purpose**: A minimal OpenTelemetry Collector distribution that acts as the runtime environment for the `complybeacon` evidence pipeline, specifically by hosting the `truthbeam` processor.

**Key Responsibilities**:
* Receiving log records from sources like `proofwatch`
* Running the `truthbeam` log processor on each log record.
* Exporting the processed, enriched logs to a configured backend.

### 3. TruthBeam

**Purpose**: To enrich log records with compliance-related context by querying the `compass` service. This is the core logic that transforms a simple policy check into an actionable compliance event.

**Key Responsibilities**:
* Maintains a local, in-memory cache of previously enriched data to reduce API calls and improve performance.
* Queries the Compass API for enrichment data based on attributes in the log record.
* Skips enrichment on API failures, tagging the log record with an enrichment_status: skipped attribute to enable graceful degradation.
* Adds the returned enrichment data as new attributes to the log record.

### 4. Compass

**Purpose**: A centralized lookup service that provides compliance context. It's the source of truth for mapping policies to standards and risk attributes. Compass is maintained as a separate project at [gemara-content-service](https://github.com/complytime/gemara-content-service) and is consumed here as a pre-built container image (`ghcr.io/complytime/gemara-content-service`).

**Key Responsibilities**:
* Receiving an EnrichmentRequest from `truthbeam`.
* Performing a lookup based on the policy details.
* Returning an EnrichmentResponse with compliance attributes.
